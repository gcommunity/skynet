**Abstract**

  Social interaction is the most basic and frequent behavior of human society, and social application platform has become the core function of the Internet.

  Currently, several major social application platforms, such as Facebook, Skype, whatsapp, line, wechat and so on, almost monopolize the global social network. These platforms have gained huge wealth by using user and traffic advantages. However, these wealth should be shared freely by netizens all over the world, not just those platforms.

  Bitchat is a social ecosystem platform based on block chaining technology. It has the following three main characteristics:

- Easy to use: Bitchat as a block chain version of the &quot;whatsapp&quot; the interface is very user-friendly, everyone can easily use.
- Privacy is protected: block chain encryption technology is used to better protect user information communication privacy. Communication with all circles of friends is done directly through point-to-point, and all chat messages are encrypted using block chain private keys.
- Autonomous operation: through Token to coordinate and motivate all parties to work together to maintain the healthy operation of the network, to achieve full automation. It does not require any national corporation to maintain, nor belongs to anyone&#39;s private property, it will belong to the common wealth of the world&#39;s netizens.

Bitchat&#39;s vision is to reconstruct the next generation of decentralized value social networking platforms using block chain and distributed storage technologies to return data privacy security and digital asset values to individuals.

The Bitchat platform and all the application code released with it are completely open source, and the applications developed by commercial companies based on Bitchat are their respective assets, and whether or not open source is determined by their sovereign companies. Through the API interface, Bitchat supports the centralization of various centralized applications nowadays. Everyone, every company can develop their own applications, provide their own services to users, so as to make profits, realize the return of value.

In the future, the platform can stimulate data aggregation in a broader range, promote data flow at a higher speed, thereby improving availability and fusion value, providing value multiplier channels for all broad contributors, such as data providers, processors, users, and creating unlimited value sharing space.

**1 Social market background**

**1.1 Development history**

In 1997, the first modern social networking site, Sixdegrees.Com, was launched, allowing users to create their own accounts and make friends with other users. Around 2003, social networking sites such as Friendster and MySpace sprang up, while LinkedIn aimed at elite business people; these social networking sites became the prototype of future integrated and vertical social networking sites; Before and after 2005, large-scale social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter have emerged, using social networking for daily communication has gradually become a user habit, social networking sites have entered a rapid development stage; around 2010, the development of multi-screen technology to promote the development of mobile Internet, a large number of various types of social networking sites, such as image social software Ins. Social networking has become an integral part of most users&#39; lives, such as skype, WhatsApp, an instant messaging social software.

In overseas markets, Line has a large number of users in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Indonesia. In 2011, China Tencent launched whatsapp-like software wechat, which now has a large number of registered users and carries a variety of social relationships. After 2011, network communication technology has improved, smartphones have become more popular, mobile Internet has sprung up, and various social software has begun to focus on mobile development.

As the most important basic measure of the Internet, social networking carries the daily and high frequency interaction behavior of users. The core value of social networking includes:

- Helping users discover and build social connections;
- Provide IM instant messaging service;
- It provides users with services to produce, share, transmit and consume UGC content;
- Open to the outside world, assist developers to access, and provide users with convenient and rich application scenario services.

**1.2 Market capacity**

1)The world&#39;s total population is over 7 billion, and Internet penetration is over 45%.

The data show that the global total population size and the proportion of people using the Internet increased steadily from 2012 to 2016, with a total population of 7.44 billion in 2016, of which 45.9% were using the Internet. Media consultancy analysts believe that the world&#39;s population is growing steadily, the Internet penetration rate is also increasing year by year, the spread of the Internet wave around the world, for people to use social networks to provide conditions to meet the needs of interpersonal communication and emotional expression.

2) Global mobile social networking products have nearly 3 billion active users.

Data show that the global mobile Internet users are expected to reach 3.6 billion in 2017, of which 2.85 billion will be active users of mobile social products, accounting for 79.2% of the global mobile Internet users. Analysts believe that the rapid spread of smartphones around the world has brought the scale of mobile Internet users to a higher level. The emergence of social networking products to meet the needs of communication and sharing between people, while the mobile Internet enables people to achieve social needs in more fragmented times and scenarios. Therefore, the global mobile social networking product active user scale is also higher in mobile Internet users.

3£©Global mobile social Facebook products become dominant

According to the data, in the first half of 2017, there were 2.1 billion active Facebook users, ranking first in social software. The social products of What are Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger, ranked second and third. China&#39;s Internet giant Tencent&#39;s social software WeChat ranked four in 960 million place. Analysts believe that social software users tend to expand according to the actual social network, so the same company, especially the leading companies, different social products can better guide each other and expand the user market, such as global Facebook products, Tencent social products in China market.

2017 in the first half of the year, some well-known mobile social software active users were distributed (Top 10).

**1.3 Market pain point**

  At present, all social networking platforms with centralized structure (such as Facebook, Snapchat, Line, Skype, wechat, etc.) are faced with many painful points, such as information privacy security, low social efficiency, and uneven quality of community content.

1)User information privacy security is not guaranteed

  Users do not have any control over their information on social platforms. User profiles are the most important information in social networks. Platforms block the flow of information by setting rules, and sell users&#39; privacy as a profit model. Traditional centralized platforms require customers to provide core privacy for identity recognition (e-mail, mobile phone number, identity card information, home address, bank card information, etc.). This centralization of privacy collection means that the risk of customer core privacy leaks is extremely high.

  In September 2017, due to loopholes in the system, users&#39; personal information was stolen by hackers. Instagram also claimed that some well-known users&#39; contact information was leaked. But hacking continues to spread, and ordinary users&#39; personal information is stolen and hackers publicly sell it online (for $10 per search). It is reported that 6 million user information has been leaked, including political figures, movie stars, athletes and some media celebrities.

1)User data is collected and utilized by the platform at will.

  The current social network is a centralized structure in which users create content, and social networking sites set rules, store content, and distribute content. The interaction between users is realized through a centralized social network, using social networks to communicate and maintain interpersonal relationships, to obtain information on friends&#39; dynamics, hot content, etc., while the social network as a service provider grasps the users. The resulting information, and by analyzing the data, to obtain accurate advertising recommendations, thereby benefiting.

3)The value generated by the content created by the user is ultimately attributed to the platform, lacking incentives

  Users, as the core user group of social platform content contribution and community building, continue to contribute high-quality content. Usually, however, transaction pricing is opaque. On the one hand, social platforms manipulate exchange rates through virtual currencies and charge high transaction costs. On the other hand, this mechanism can be easily exploited by developers to obtain platform recommended traffic through fraudulent transactions and false pipelining. Opacity in Business Pricing leads advertisers, as major revenue contributors to social networks, to pay excessive advertising fees for exposure, and as users, they contribute to advertising but are not rewarded.

3)The credit system is fragile, with false information and low social efficiency.

The widespread use of false information in social products and the lack of a credit system have led to social inefficiency and difficulty in achieving social matching between acquaintances and strangers. Spam information is ubiquitous and varied. We must improve efficiency and reduce costs through automated anti-spam technology system. However, it can not completely solve the problem, resulting in poor product experience.

**2 Technical background of block chain**

**2.1 Type of block chain**

Block chain is a brand-new distributed system that uses block chain data structure to verify and store data, uses distributed node consensus algorithm to generate and update data, uses cryptography technology to ensure the security of data transmission and access control, and uses intelligent contract composed of automatic script code to program and operate data. Infrastructure and computing paradigm. At present, block chain has been called a major breakthrough technology by many large organizations to completely change the business and even the operation mode of the organization. In the fields of finance, Internet of Things, charity, health care, supply chain and so on, more and more enterprises begin to explore the application prospects of block chain in the industry, and plan the data flow roadmap based on block chain technology.

Block chain is divided into public chain, private chain and alliance chain according to the application scenario and design£º

- Public chain: represented by bitcoin, Ethernet and all digital currencies, each node can enter or exit the block chain network freely.
- Private Chain: Access and exit privileges for each node are controlled internally, usually for internal data management and auditing within a particular organization.

Alliance chain: Each node usually represents an entity organization or individual, and usually needs to be authorized to join or exit the network. Since there are usually related interests among agencies, it is necessary for all parties to participate and maintain them.

**2.2 Characteristics of block chains**

The existing block chaining technology mainly includes the following four characteristics:

1. 1)De centralization: there is no need for third party intervention to achieve point to point transactions, coordination and collaboration. In block chain system, no organization or individual can control the global data, and any node stops working will not affect the overall operation of the system. This decentralized network will greatly improve data security.
2. 2)Non tampering: block chains use encryption technology to verify and store data, and use distributed consensus algorithm to add and update data. Block chains require each node to participate in the verification transaction and block out; modifying any data requires changing all subsequent records, modifying single node data is extremely difficult.
3. 3)Transparency and traceability: written block content copies the backup to each node, each node has the latest complete database copy and all record information is public, anyone can query the block data through the public interface. Each transaction in the block chain is solidified into the block data by chain storage, and all transaction records in all blocks are superimposed by cryptographic algorithms. Therefore, it can be traced back to any transaction history.
4. 4)Collective Maintainability: the decentralization of block chain determines its collective maintenance. Traditional centralized organizations usually have three roles: data savers, data managers, and data analysts. Block chains are maintained by all participants in a reciprocal manner, with clear responsibilities and powers. There is no need to transfer rights to a third party to achieve joint collaboration.

**2.3 Development trend of block chain**

Block chains will have a huge impact on the existing economic and social, and are expected to reshape the pattern of human Internet activities. The recent development trend of block chain is mainly in the following aspects:

1. 1)Application mode upgrade

In view of the security of public chains and the balance between the increasing volume of transactions and the existing network capacity, the future application of block chains will be dominated by alliance chains, private chains or hybrid chains. Bitcoin increases the maintenance cost of block chain network, which is not entirely applicable to low-value, low-risk transactions. Considering the improvement of efficiency and security, the future block chain will be an open application platform based on distributed storage.

1. 2)Multi centralization

In the future, the architecture of block chain system will be to build a trusted multi-center system, which will upgrade the decentralized and independent single center to a unified multi-center with multi-party participation, so as to improve the efficiency of trust transfer and reduce transaction costs. That is, under the environment of information asymmetry and uncertainty, we should establish an ecological system of &quot;trust&quot; to meet the occurrence and development of various activities.

1. 3)From financial innovation to other industries application breakthrough

  The application of block chains will begin with the need for mutual trust among the parties to the transaction, but it is not easy to establish trust relations, such as finance, securities, insurance and other fields. With the popularization of applications and the improvement of social awareness, block chains will gradually penetrate into all sectors of society. For example, block chains have been initially applied to political elections, corporate shareholder voting, gambling, market forecasting and other fields.

4£© Socialization of intelligent contracts

  In the future, all contract-based agreements will be intelligent, and intelligent contracts can ensure the reliable implementation of all agreements, avoid tampering, repudiation and breach of contract.

5£©Asset Digitalization

  In addition to converting tangible assets into digital intelligent assets for power confirmation, authorization and real-time monitoring, block chain can also be applied to intangible assets management in society, such as intellectual property protection, domain name management, integral management and other fields.

**3 Application scenario of Bitchat**
**3.1 Wallet supporting multiple digital currencies**

  Bitchat&#39;s application scenarios include centralization wallets that support multiple digital currencies.

  Block chain is a kind of value Internet, and token is the core and cornerstone of value Internet. With token and safe custody, all kinds of decentralized applications on the block chain can be used. Therefore, Bitchat will support multiple token collection and transfer functions, and users can easily extract tokens previously purchased at the exchange and save them in their own Bitchat through Bitchat.

- Bitchat&#39;s wallet function is decentralization. Decentralization means that the user&#39;s digital assets will no longer be just a number in the centralized database, but actually recorded on the block chain of digital assets, each transaction of the user will be truthfully recorded, can not be tampered with.
- The wallet function of Bitchat is safe. Bitchat uses elliptic curve cryptography and double signature technology to encrypt signatures for each transaction, and absolutely does not save and transmit the user&#39;s private key. At the same time, it will provide the function of cold wallet to ensure the safety of users&#39; assets.
- Bitchat&#39;s wallet function is easy to use. Compared to other products, Bitchat will provide a complete user experience and make it as easy as possible for users to manage digital assets. And support a variety of token exchange.

**3.2 Decentralization of point to point encryption communication**

Today&#39;s social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Line, wechat, and so on, are centralized databases in which messages sent by everyone are stored in the databases of their owners. Therefore, the owners of social networks have the God mode so that they can be examined and filtered.

  In Bitchat, a point-to-point encryption communication service is provided to encrypt messages that users need to deliver. Only the sender and the receiver can decrypt the contents of the conversation, and these contents will be stored locally or distributed to the global network by the sender and the receiver only. And it will never appear in any other third-party system, thus guaranteeing social privacy and concealment.

  Application scenario:

  Bitchat users to perform privacy of communication, chat, social networking is free, and only when the user is actively hiring miners saved to the encrypted information distributed when needed to pay TOKEN as a storage space provided by the global network of remuneration.

  Scene instance:

- Users A and B use Bitchat for private chats, and Bitchat automatically sets up a point-to-point temporary communication line for encrypted transmission, which is free. After they have finished chatting, they can choose to save it on their mobile phone or pay Token to save it on a distributed block chain network.
- Users C and D use Bitchat for non-traceable communication. They choose not to pay Token to save the communication history. Because Bitchat uses point-to-point communication and key encryption technology, all the information disappears after their communication, and there is no archive on the local mobile phone.

**3.3 Trustworthy social networking**

  A very important factor in social networks is trust. In Bitchat, users can also use Token to purchase certificate labels from third-party authentication development agencies to avoid false users.

  Based on the de-centralization and non-tampering nature of the block chain, any official information issued by an authenticated user on Bitchat, whether correct or incorrect, can not be tampered with or deleted and has legal effect. This kind of social interaction is completely trustworthy, which is to pay the cost of Token.

Application of TOKEN:

- It is necessary to use TOKEN token to create private social networks and join private social networks.

TOKEN can be used to buy identity authentication in social networks.

Scene instance:

- User A is an investment manager who wants to discuss the future of the New York stock market. He needs participants to pay at least 20 TOKENs as eligibility.
- User B is the founder of Dapps and wants to publish information about his project. He needs participants to have at least one of his own project tokens, such as project tokens.
- User C is an entrepreneur who wants to build his own social network with more prominent tags on social networks, so he needs TOKEN to buy a certificate tag.

**3.4 Pay for knowledge**

  Bitchat will provide the most basic knowledge of facility services in the field of pay. The Information is a star knowledge payment company in the field of knowledge payment, and its high fees are recognized by everyone. Bitchat will do digital empowerment for knowledge through block-chain technology, serve the knowledge-paying industry, and provide a channel for opinion leaders, technology cafes, and investment experts in the community to turn knowledge into their own gains.

  Users can invite people they like, such as opinion leaders, and pay a small amount of TOKEN to answer questions. Others can use very few TOKEN to eavesdrop on their questions and answers. The income generated by TOKEN for answering questions will be earned by the respondents, while the TOKEN paid by eavesdroppers will be distributed between the respondents and the respondents.

  By paying for this knowledge, we can move the whole ecosystem forward faster and better.

  User scenario:

  TOKEN is needed to pay for knowledge.

  Scene instance:

- User A can use 10 TOKENs to ask a Chief Engineer to answer some questions, and the 10 TOKENs here are assigned to the respondents.
- User B can use 0.1 TOKEN to understand the conversation between the two of them, so as to get the same knowledge.
- If 100 users B understand User A&#39;s answer, then these additional income will be assigned to the questioner and the respondent.

**3.5 DAPP store**

  For a public chain, its value comes from the number of users using the public chain. To a large extent, the number of users depends on the number of DAPP deployed on public chains. The more valuable DAPPs there are in a public chain, the more users there will be and the faster the growth will be. This is ecosystem, the ecosystem.

  Bitchat will set up a DAPP store to welcome partners such as Block Chain Technologies Community and developers to publish their DAPP and Smart Contracts in the DAPP store. At the same time, we will make it easy for users to get the DAPP and intelligent contract they need, and use Bitchat TOKEN-based evaluation system to judge DAPP. And for smart contracts, we will allow users to use them in social networks, such as voting, predicting, or executing contracts.

  Application of TOKEN:

-  Developers need to use a certain TOKEN to publish smart contracts in the DAPP store and be used by users.
- Developers need to use a certain TOKEN in order to be able to publish DAPPs in the Bitchat App Store, in order to avoid some fraudulent DAPPs on the shelves.

Scene instance:

- Developer A can publish the smart contracts he develops, and as long as these contracts are used by the user, part of the fee is automatically allocated to the developer. This will enable users to develop some excellent intelligent contracts and expand the community.
- Developer B can publish a DAPP in the Bitchat store so that it can be accessed and used by more people.

User C, who needs to have a certain number of TOKENs in the account (no payment is required), has the right to evaluate and score DAPP to avoid malicious behavior.

**3.6 Expression and skin Market**

  For today&#39;s new generation of Internet users, expressions and skin are just the need in their social networks. The younger users, the more stable and persistent the demand for expressions and skin. Just in the newly released iPhone X, a very big selling point is the expression pack based on face recognition technology, which fully illustrates the huge expression and skin market.

  In Bitchat, we&#39;ll build our unique expression and skin market, we&#39;ll define a set of specifications that allow users to create and submit their expressions and skin, and allow users to use TOKEN to buy their favorite expressions and skin packs. In the process, TOKEN is the exchange, and the writers of these expressions and skin get most of the reward.

Application of TOKEN:

- Purchase and use facial expression pack, skin packs.

Scene instance:

- Users can choose what they like in the expression and skin market, then purchase through TOKEN.
- Emotional and skin writers can submit their creative emoticons and skin packs in Bitchat&#39;s Emotional and Skin Store, set their prices, and split them into relationships, thus earning a generous TOKEN Commission for future emoticons and skin sales.
- The release builds the current socially popular emoticons and skins in all major regions of the world, but allows users to start their own expressions and skin online sales to make a profit.

**3.7 User generated content community**

For a social network, UGC (User Generate Content) is essential. Through UGC and the guidance of opinion leaders, the entire community can have enough activity.

  For the community, we Bitchat will support third-party companies to establish a variety of UGC community, increase the number of communities, increase the viscosity of the community, to increase the level of activity of the community and the topic of discussion. And all of this is based on the UGC community created by the TOKEN system.

  In UGC&#39;s community system, users can post their own articles, thoughts, and ideas, and push them to users in the community through the community&#39;s push engine. Users can also like, comment, and encourage using these articles. For those who continue to contribute high-quality articles, the more value they create, the higher their reputation, the higher their status as opinion leaders, and the better they can get high quality and high priority push. . Compared to previous centralized systems, such a rule engine is algorithmically driven, fully transparent, and managed and monitored by all community members.

  Application scenario:

- Content producers need to have a certain amount of TOKEN before they can push UGC content.
- According to the content label type, it will be pushed to the Bitchat community users through the Bitchat push engine.
- Bitchat TOKEN users can use their favorite content for a reward
- After rising premium content, the content of the author&#39;s position will continue to improve, and will be given priority to push open source Bitchat push engine, and can be combined and advertisers, resulting in an open, transparent, reasonable return.

**3.8 Advantages of Bitchat**

By way of decentralized operation, Bitchat established with the traditional social networks completely different mode of operation: return control of user data and information to individuals and provide incentives to contributing users. This mode is to ensure the security of personal data, and the second is to stimulate everyone to make more contributions through system mechanisms. At this time, the network is no longer a central hub, but a pure platform, a platform where users can interact peer-to-peer.

**4 Technical scheme**

**4.1 Technical orientation**

  Bitchat is committed to creating a new value based social ecology based on block chain technology. Bitchat is located in:

  &quot;No identity&quot;: Using Bitchat social network does not require authentication to ensure that the user&#39;s identity information coming to the platform is not leaked.

  &quot;Distributed&quot;: Distributed storage technology based on user&#39;s personal key encryption can completely protect the privacy of users;

  &quot;Weak ties&quot;: locate on the social platform of strangers.

  &quot;Strong personality&quot;: fully enable users to show their individuality, orientation and needs.



**4.2 Overall architecture**

Bitchat ecological scripting language based on C ++ language development, but also exported Turing-complete language, intelligent service contract block chain as the main mission.

Bitchat layer mainly composed of the underlying technology, the contract layer, the interface layer and application layer:


- The underlying technology layer is developed based on the core idea of block chain. The underlying peer-to-peer network consists of computers provided by global miners, private cloud storage devices, and Internet of Things devices that run Bitchat&#39;s mining programs and network protocol stacks and are free to join and exit. Bitchat&#39;s mining procedures and protocol stack cover Windows, MacOS, Linux, and embedded platform system.
- Intelligent contract layer includes reward contract, payment contract and prize contract. It is supported by Turing&#39;s complete bitup language. All intelligent contracts are guarded by scripts provided by it.
- Interface Layer Open Platform API: All APIs will be suitable for most of the current platforms, including static libraries, dynamic libraries, Java language, Dll, etc., for use by various platforms. Including data access, index, query, fragmentation, search, status information, including network communication, penetration, connection, transmission, encryption, decryption and other types, for the development of applications to provide the most complete interface and documents .
- Application layer: Developers can implement various rich application scenarios on the application layer to promote the ecological prosperity of the community.

**4.3 User privacy and session privacy mechanism**

** ** All users who use bitChat are not authenticated with real names. Privacy information for all communications is passed to the other party by default and terminates. Bitchat provides a Token way for users to pay to store miners for information that needs to be stored for a long time if they need to be saved for a long time.

- Through the encryption mechanism of digital key, user ID (account), digital signature, the authentic identity of the user is completely isolated, and the core privacy of the user is protected. The only identification ID of the user on the platform is the number obtained from a series of hash algorithms of the user&#39;s private key and public key which are authenticated and signed.
- Bitchat will not record, nor can it trace back to users&#39; chat records. But Bitchat has designed an intelligent contract to prevent illegal information, such as child pornography, from moving on the platform. Users are allowed to conduct public voting against illegal information.
- Bitchat will provide users with a secure, credible, core privacy-preserving social environment that allows them to fully demonstrate their personality, orientation, and make bold appeals. A secure and efficient point-to-point session is implemented by using public-private key system and symmetric session key.

**4.4 Distributed storage**

  Bitchat has its own distributed storage system. It is a completely point-to-point distributed storage protocol. All private cloud storage devices, mining machines and computers compatible with Bitchat have accessible access to the BiChat distributed storage network to provide their own storage space for Token rewards. It differs from other distributed systems in that it contains more power, penetrates the intranet, and allows simple participation in rewarding environments that meet mining requirements at the user&#39;s home.

  Bitchat distributed storage protocol also uses content addressing instead of traditional domain name addressing. Users do not need to care about the location of the service, do not need to consider the name and path of the file storage. The user stores the personal information in the bitChat node, encrypts the user&#39;s key and stores it, and then obtains the unique encrypted hash value based on the encrypted content. Hash values directly reflect the contents of a file, even if only one bit of file content is modified, the corresponding hash values will be completely different. When a user is asked to hash a file, it uses a distributed hash table to find the node where the file is located,

retrieves the file and verifies the file data, and then decrypts it with the user&#39;s key to restore the original information.

  BitChat is also an infrastructure for general purpose, with no storage constraints. Big data will be segmented into small chunks, which can be obtained from multiple servers at the same time. The bitChat network is also unfixed and fine-grained, which can be well adapted to the requirements of the content distribution network. Such a design can better store all kinds of data besides communication information, including images, video streams, distributed databases, the entire operating system, module chains, 8 inch floppy disk backup and so on.

**4.5 Intelligent contract**

Intelligent contract technology based on block chaining technology includes transaction processing and preservation mechanism. Intelligent contract system sets trigger conditions according to event description information. When trigger conditions are satisfied, intelligent contract will automatically execute the specified contents of the contract. Intelligent contract is irreversible, once completed, it will not be modified or deleted, with strong security.

On this basis, Bitchat will focus on building smart contract module design, according to different social needs, pre-designed general module. When customers need to engage in social activities, they only need to set minimal parameters and requirements, that is, quickly draw up intelligent contracts, and take effect immediately to eliminate risks.

**4.6 Mining**

BitChat is a global free-running network, completely decentralized, to make it run freely must have its own incentive mechanism to maintain the operation of the network. The machines provided by miners are the foundation of decentralization, and all the routing, information forwarding, dissemination, and relationships are synchronized in the machines. The storage of chat information and communication information is paid by the user to offset the cost of distributed storage by Token.

After the Bitchat is formally launched, it releases a certain amount of Token per day according to the number of users. Each node is both a data receiver and a data pusher, and each node drives the Bitchat network to light up every corner of the world.



**4.7 Communication**

  Communications and the Internet, which require Data transmission, are often used in Transmission Control Protocol, UDP-based, reliable transport protocols (UDT, UDP-based Data Transfer Protocol) , which can be used in the field of wired and wireless communication, data communication between personal computers (pc) or handheld terminals and mobile communications devices via wired or wireless networks. For example, data exchange between mobile terminals and PC, PC and PC. But the congestion control mechanism in traditional TCP protocols is based on the fact that congestion is the cause of packet loss. Moreover, in order to be compatible with the friendliness of different TCP implementations, this mechanism can not adapt to wired, wireless networks with high bit error rate, link packet loss caused by high delay and slow acceleration. Taking the traditional TCP protocol as an example, because of its inherent and acquired reasons, it can not meet the existing requirements in many application fields. In order to be compatible with the earlier version of TCP 1.1, conservative algorithm is adopted in the algorithm, and conservative algorithm is used in the overtime retransmission and transmission window enlargement algorithm, which leads to a certain loss of efficiency. On the other hand, the algorithm has some defects in the retransmission strategy, and the recovery speed is relatively slow. And TCP mainly for wired network design, at higher bit error rate, a sharp decline in performance, bitChat reconstructed on the basis of the application layer udp protocol on the increase in applications to overcome the internal network penetration in the high error Rate and high latency issues.

  BitChat mainly udp communication technology for both point-to optimize the independent retransmission mechanisms to seize more bandwidth usage designed multi congregation. The two sides&#39; keys are used to irreversibly encrypt the communication content, ensuring that the information transmitted on the network will not be leaked and cracked. It is by far the safest network communication platform.

**4.8 Transmission**

  BiChat optimizes the upstream bandwidth of the fully profitable network thoroughly to ensure that there is no significant delay in data transmission.

**4.8.1 bitChat&#39;s bandwidth estimation and prediction.**

  When detecting the maximum sending window, the RENO algorithm is used to detect packet loss. But in the process, bitChat also checked the ACK response rate. When the ACK response frequency changes (change rate K \&gt; 0.35), it indicates that the network has now fluctuated and can be predicted to reach the congestion threshold. This is similar to VEGAS, which can predict congestion ahead of time. At this time UDX adjusts the slow start threshold and enters the congestion avoidance ahead of time. Stage.

  Combined with the SACK algorithm, each ACK has multiple reply packets. Therefore, the selective retransmission is accurately realized. The unnecessary retransmission is reduced. The difference from the traditional ACK is that more ACKs are associated, and a new ACK structure is designed, and the compressed ACK method is added, so that the amount of response data is also a bit less.

  In the congestion avoidance phase, congestion is predicted in advance by calculating DIFF = minrtt\*(wnd/minrtt - wnd/rtt) \&lt; avgbew\*0.35f. This difference is in avgbew, which is calculated from the ACK response and is close to the true value. This avoids the inaccuracy of the traditional VEGAS calculations (generally inaccurate occurs due to the hardware speed limit of the gateway).

  Packet loss detection algorithm, each packet is recorded on the last transmission time and the maximum transmission sequence number, when the ACK received and compared with the current corresponding quantity, you can accurately know which packet needs to be retransmitted, without waiting for the time-out arrival.

  Quick recovery, when bitChat receives two new ACKs in succession, immediately restores to the previous send window, reducing recovery cancellation.

  Combined with WEST WOOD, the traffic is calculated by statistical method, and the theoretical transmission window is compared with the actual transmission window by RTT/WND=BEW formula, so as to improve the stability and make the transmission stable in the actual generation width.

**4.8.2 Rapid retransmission**

The ACK design of bitChat is actually the SACK protocol. but is different SACK, sack sequence number, a head and tail, while bitChat a starting sequence number, serial number and relative composition of the latter, which can accommodate more ACK. When the sender receives an ACK can be any accurate Determine which package has been lost, and then retransmit immediately, without waiting for the timeout to retransmit, thus improving real-time and indirectly improving throughput.



**4.8.3 What improvements are made on AIDM?**

  The slow start phase and the TCP class are W += 1, and the congestion avoidance phase is W += 1/W;**

  BiChat also uses different design methods for window management, in which a saturated state, i.e. the best state, is introduced. The actual sending speed is 1.25 times the sending speed of this optimum state. This ensures higher competition.**

  In bitChat, the unit of measurement is the current traffic, and the core idea of the control window is to control the increment of traffic. When the increment approaches the \&lt;= 5% fluctuation of the actual flow, it is considered that the flow is already the maximum, and then it enters the saturation state.**** When bitChat enters the saturation state, it turns to the congestion avoidance acceleration mode, and the window decreases instead of enlarging, reaching a dynamic horizontal, so that the transmission speed is always stable at a level.**

  Another difference is that window control is that traditional TCP grows by a maximum of 1 per cycle, whereas bitChat is ACK-driven window growth and does not limit its variation within RTT, so its acceleration may exceed 1 per RTT.**

 bitChat carried out for different network automatically adapts to the RTT of the algorithm, we introduced the concept of a theory of my own and named traffic flow management he calculated the data actually received is compared, when the flow is less than the actual flow theory would Window Correct it so that it stays at the window size of the current flow so that the flow is smoother and there is no deviation.**** Only the smoothness of flow can make other parameters meaningful, otherwise the flow control becomes empty talk, which is the shortcoming of other algorithms.**

  Packet loss control: every time bitChat receives a packet loss signal, it adjusts the congestion window by using sstresh = wnd \* a, wnd + = b, where a, B (negative) is the bitChat empirical value, and the specific parameters can be adjusted.**

  Combining with packet loss control: BitChat calculates the packet loss rate once every 100 ACKs, adjusts A and B according to the packet loss rate, so it can adjust the window according to the actual network situation. In order to pursue maximum speed, bitChat is appropriate to allow packet loss to ensure maximum data throughput.**

**4.9 Scripting language**

The grammar for bitUp is similar to Javascript, an object-oriented language that is also executed based on virtual machines. But as a de-centralized contract running on the network in a real sense, it has many differences. Here are some examples:

The bottom of bitUp is based on account rather than UTXO, so there is a special type of Address. The code used to locate the user, locate the contract, and locate the contract (the contract itself is also an account).

Because the language embedded framework supports payment, it provides keywords, such as payable, that support payment directly at the language level, and are super simple.

Storage is the use of block chains on the network, each state of data can be stored permanently, so you need to determine whether variables use memory or block chains.

The Java runtime environment is on a bitChat decentralized network that places more emphasis on the way contracts or functions are called. Because a simple function call turns out to be code execution in a network node, a distributed feel.

The last big difference is its exception mechanism, and if an exception occurs, all executions will be withdrawn, mainly to ensure the atomicity of contract execution to avoid inconsistent data in the intermediate state.

11 Risk hints

As a new investment mode, digital asset investment has various risks. Potential investors need to carefully assess the investment risk and their own risk tolerance.

- Token sales market risks

Because Token&#39;s sales market environment is inseparable from the overall digital money market situation, such as the overall market downturn, or the presence of other uncontrollable factors, may cause Token itself, even with good prospects, but prices are still in a long-term undervalued state.

- Regulatory risk

As the development of block chain is still in its early stage, there are no relevant regulations and documents concerning the pre-requirement, transaction requirement, information disclosure requirement, lock-in requirement and so on in the ICO process in the world, including China. And how the policy will be implemented is still unclear, these factors may have an uncertain impact on the investment and liquidity of the project. Block chain technology has become a major regulatory target in all major countries in the world. If regulators intervene or exert influence, BITCHAT applications may be affected, such as statutory restrictions on the use of Token, sales of Token such as BITCHAT Coin may be restricted, hindered or even directly terminated BITCHAT applications and the development of BITCHAT Coin.

-  Competition risk

With the development of information technology and mobile Internet, digital assets represented by &quot;Bitcoin&quot; are gradually rising, various kinds of decentralized applications continue to emerge, and competition in the industry is becoming increasingly fierce. However, with the emergence and expansion of other application platforms, the community will face continuous operational pressure and certain market competition risks.

-  Risk of staff turnover

BITCHAT has assembled a group of leading and experienced technical teams and consultants in their respective fields of expertise, including long-term professionals in the block chain industry and core teams with rich experience in Internet product development and operation. The stability of the core team and the resources of consultants are of great significance for BITCHAT to maintain the core competitiveness of the industry. The loss of core personnel or advisory team may affect the stable operation of the platform or bring some adverse effects on the future development.

-  Lack of funds leads to risks that cannot be exploited

Due to the large drop in Token prices raised by the founding team or the development time exceeding the expectations, there may be a lack of team development funds, which may lead to the team&#39;s extreme lack of funds, thus failing to achieve the original development goals.

-  Risk of loss of private key

After the purchaser&#39;s BITCHAT Coin extracts its own digital wallet address, the only way to manipulate the content contained in the address is the purchaser&#39;s related key (i.e. private key or wallet password). Users are responsible for protecting related keys and signing transaction his private key file or password is lost or stolen separately, the obtained BITCHAT Coin associated with the user account (address) or password will be unrecoverable and permanently lost. The best way to safely store login credentials is for the purchaser to store the keys in one or more places securely, and preferably not on a public computer.

- Hacker or theft risk

Hackers or other organizations or countries may attempt to interrupt applications or the possibility of BITCHAT Coin functions in any way, including but not limited to, denial of service attacks, Sybil attacks, guerrilla attacks, malware attacks, or consistent attacks.

-  Risk of uninsured loss

Unlike bank accounts or accounts of other financial institutions, which are stored in BITCHAT accounts or related block chain networks, there is usually no insurance coverage, and no public individual organization will insure your losses in any case.

-  Risks associated with core agreements

The BITCHAT platform is currently based on Ethernet development, so any failure in ethernet, unexpected functional problems or attacks can cause the BITCHAT Coin or platform to stop working or missing functionality in unpredictable ways.

-  Systemic risk

The fatal defects that are ignored in open source software or the risks caused by large-scale failure of the global network infrastructure. While some of these risks will be substantially mitigated over time, such as fixing loopholes and breaking computational bottlenecks, others remain unpredictable, such as political factors or natural disasters that may cause some or global Internet disruptions.

-  Risk of loopholes or cryptography to accelerate development

The acceleration of cryptography or technological advances such as quantum computers or the risk of cracking the BITCHAT platform could lead to the loss of BITCHAT Coin.

-  Application risk of lack of attention

The possibility that BITCHAT applications are not used by a large number of individuals or organizations means that the public does not have enough interest in developing and developing these related distributed applications. Such a lack of interest may have a negative impact on BITCHAT Coin and applications.

-  Risk of being denied or lacking users

First, BITCHAT Coin should not be regarded as an investment. Although BITCHAT Coin may have some value over time, it may be very small if it is not recognized by the market and thus lacks users. What is likely to happen is that for any possible reason, including but not limited to the failure of a business relationship or marketing strategy, the BITCHAT platform and all subsequent marketing supported by crowdfunds will not succeed. If this happens, there may be no follow-up or few follow-up without this platform, which is obviously very unfavorable for the project. Application risk of failure BITCHAT platform may fail due to various known or unknown reasons (such as large-scale node downtime), unable to provide normal services, serious cases may lead to the loss of user BITCHAT Coin.

-  The application or product does not meet the expected risk of itself or the purchaser

BITCHAT applications are currently in the development stage and may undergo major changes before the release of the official version. Any expectation or imagination of the BITCHAT Coin itself or of the purchaser for the functionality or form of the application or BITCHAT Coin (including the behavior of the participants) may not be met. Any erroneous analysis, a design change, etc. This may cause this to happen.

- Unpredictable other risks

The cryptography-based Token is a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks mentioned in this white paper, there are some risks that the founding team has not mentioned or expected. In addition, other risks may occur suddenly or in combination with a variety of risks already mentioned.

Concluding remarks

Block chains from the concept to application, broad prospects but facing multiple constraints, &quot;Block chains +comprehensive health&quot; the same. In the actual development process, it still faces technical bottlenecks, high commercial costs, exchange rate risks, security risks, privacy protection and other problems. In particular, the characteristics of the center block and autonomy of block chains weaken the concept of state regulation. In the case of unreachable regulation, the profit-seeking characteristics of the market will lead to the application of block chain technology in illegal areas, providing a &quot;shelter&quot; for the black industry.

Therefore, it can be said that block chain + comprehensive health has good prospect and the realistic is cruel.

Faced with many constraints and risk factors, &quot;block chain + comprehensive health&quot;, in order to meet compliance requirements, the combination of block chain + legal currency, may become the mainstream application model of block chain in the payment field. At the same time, the mode of cross border payment based on block chain is not yet mature. Although payment through the block chain can greatly improve efficiency, but to truly achieve this goal, the current block chain technology alone is not enough, at least a few orders of magnitude of improvement is needed.

In the future, BITCHAT will continue to enhance its exploration and research in the area of block chains and large data, and will become an important builder of encrypted digital currency ecology in the global health field, constantly breaking through the &quot;technical barriers&quot; of block chain technology, constantly changing the business model of information storage, and ultimately achieving maximum benefits.
